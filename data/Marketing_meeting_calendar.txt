Hi, I am a 32-year-old, businessman. As a businessman who primarily deals with cash, I was frustrated when my credit card was frozen. I may have a lot of spending transactions, but being flagged as suspicious is not something I am looking for in my busy life. Which credit card can offer higher privacy protection for transaction records? How can I get peace of mind knowing my financial information is safe and secure? I'm a 32-year-old businessman who primarily deals with cash. Recently, I experienced a frustrating situation when my credit card got frozen. While I understand the need for security measures, being flagged as suspicious due to my spending transactions which is not something I want to deal with in my busy life. I'm looking for recommendations on credit cards that offer higher privacy protection for transaction records. It's important for me to have peace of mind knowing that my financial information is safe and secure. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! CASE 2 - UNLIMITED CREDIT LIMIT https://www.utgl.net/solutions/personal/use-cases-unlimited-spender I 've been a Amex Black Card user for a while now I was initially impressed by the card's no-limit feature . However, I soon realized that it was more of a hassle than a benefit. Every time I tried to make a large purchase, my card would get declined, and I had to call customer service to request a limit increase. It was a major inconvenience and made me question the card's value. Please suggest to me something that truly has unlimited credit and can set our credit limit if needed. Any suggestions or advice would be great and very helpful. Thank You CASE 3 - SUCCESSION PLANNING & ADDITIONAL CARDS https://www.utgl.net/solutions/personal/use-cases-family-wealth-inheritance I am a single mother with a 15-year-old child, and I have been in a committed relationship with my new boyfriend recently.
