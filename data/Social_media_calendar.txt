Name: Hong Kong Pushes for Crypto Tax Exemptions to Attract Asset Managers
Content: Hong Kong is set to bolster its status as a financial hub with proposed tax exemptions on cryptocurrency gains and other assets. Aiming to lure elite investors, these incentives target hedge funds, private equity firms, and billionaire family offices. The move, outlined in a 20-page government document currently under legislative review, forms part of a broader strategy to offer a more competitive tax landscape. The exemptions will extend beyond crypto, covering private credit, overseas property, and carbon credits. Patrick Yip, vice chair at Deloitte China, highlighted that these measures would provide certainty for investors and family offices, which are increasingly allocating their portfolios toward digital assets. "This is a significant step toward enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a financial and crypto hub," Yip said. Hong Kong's proposed tax breaks come as it competes with Singapore, another major regional financial hub also courting wealthy investors and asset managers. While Singapore has introduced lightly taxed fund structures, stricter anti-money laundering regulations have slowed the establishment of family offices there—an opportunity Hong Kong hopes to capitalize on. To stay competitive, Hong Kong has also been promoting its open-ended fund company structure, which allows for large pools of assets under a low-tax framework. Over 450 such funds have been launched in Hong Kong, compared to more than 1,000 in Singapore under its variable capital company structure. Darren Bowdern, head of asset management tax for Asia at KPMG, noted that Hong Kong’s new tax measures could help level the playing field by removing tax liability risks for fund managers, putting it on par with major finance hubs like Singapore and Luxembourg. The reforms reflect Hong Kong’s ambitions to reclaim a leading position in global wealth management, with UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti suggesting that the city could even surpass Switzerland as a wealth management center. As digital assets gain popularity and ultra-high-net-worth individuals pivot their investment strategies, Hong Kong’s latest initiative underscores its determination to remain a key player in global finance and innovation. The outcome of this proposal may significantly shape the city’s future in the global crypto economy.

Content: By now you know that when it comes to protecting your legacy, a TRUST is the ultimate game-changer. Unlike a will, which gets tied up in probate, a trust allows you to pass on your assets smoothly and privately. No court delays, no unnecessary costs, no public scrutiny. But that’s not all—Trusts also offer powerful tax benefits, helping reduce estate taxes and ensuring more of your hard-earned wealth goes to your loved ones. Plus trust also gives you control over when and how your beneficiaries receive their inheritance. Want to ensure your kids get their assets at a certain age or under specific conditions? A trust can do that! It’s a flexible tool that can adapt to changes in your life and financial goals, making it the perfect way to secure your loved ones’ future with peace of mind.

Her estate became tangled in a legal battle that stretched on for years, all because of probate. When someone passes away, probate is the court process that steps in, dragging out the distribution of assets and often adding unnecessary stress to grieving loved ones. It’s slow, expensive, and public—meaning family affairs are exposed for everyone to see. But what if there was a way to avoid probate entirely? In the next post, we’ll explore the difference between wills and trusts—and reveal which one is the clear winner in estate planning.

Content: You’ve probably heard of both wills and trusts, but what’s the real difference between them? A will is a legal document that spells out how you want your assets distributed after you pass away. Sounds simple, right? But here’s the catch: a will has to go through probate, which means delays, extra costs, and no privacy. A trust, on the other hand, lets you transfer your assets directly to your loved ones without ever stepping foot in court. It bypasses probate completely, saving time and keeping things private. So, when it comes to estate planning, which one is the clear winner? Stay tuned to find out why a trust might be the smartest move you can make.

Content: Trust vs Will: Which Is Better for Estate Planning? Estate planning can seem overwhelming, but it's crucial to protect what matters most to you. Most people know about wills, but what about trusts? Let’s explore the key differences and discover why a trust might be the smarter, more effective choice for your estate. Wills go through probate – a public, court-supervised process to validate the will and manage the estate. This process can be time-consuming , costly , and public . Anyone can access probate records, which may not be ideal for those who value privacy. Trusts Avoid Probate A trust bypasses probate entirely. Assets are managed according to the terms of the trust without court involvement. This makes the process quicker , private , and less stressful for loved ones More Control Over Asset Distribution A trust allows you to dictate how and when beneficiaries receive their inheritance. You can set conditions and even provide ongoing financial support. With a will, assets are distributed in a lump sum after probate, often limiting flexibility. 4. Potential Challenges in a Will Wills can lead to disputes among beneficiaries and are vulnerable to challenges in court. Trusts provide more certainty and help minimize conflicts by setting clear rules for asset distribution. Summary Wills : Require probate, are public, and place a burden on an executor. Trusts : Avoid probate, are private, offer more control, and reduce stress for your loved ones. 6.Call to Action Want a smoother estate planning process? Consider a trust for greater privacy and ease. Connect with UniTurst today to see what’s best for you and your loved ones.
